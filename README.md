# Chipmunk + Simple 2D (SDL) demo

This is a demonstration of how to add physics to a [Simple 2D](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d) / [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) application using [Chipmunk](http://chipmunk-physics.net).

First, install dependencies. On macOS with Homebrew, install Simple 2D (see the [README](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d#readme) for other OSes):

```
$ brew tap simple2d/tap && brew install simple2d
```

Install Chipmunk, for example:

```
$ brew install chipmunk
